One shot learning of chest xray images

Deep learning Models trained using supervised methods need to be retrained when a new class (with its samples) is introduced. It is  computationaly expensive. One-shot Learning,  is intended to classify a set of data from diffierent classes from one or a few number of annotated examples.

This workk creates to manually created CNN model that are combined to form a Siamese Net(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) to classify images.
No fine tuning is performed. It implements the basic version using a eucledian distance measure.
